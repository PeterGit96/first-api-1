# Exercise - Spring Boot - First API 1
* write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that has:
  * a `NameController` where you map `name` in order to:
    * reply with your name to a `GET` request
    * reply with your reversed name (e.g. from `John` to `nhoJ`, using `StringBuilder`) to a `POST` request
* test the API endpoint with `Postman`, executing a `GET` and a `POST` request
* **note for reviewers**: view `FirstApi1.postman_collection.json` in the root folder for the `Postman` calls
